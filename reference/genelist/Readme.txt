Highlights
We summarized 977 epilepsy-associated genes, which were divided into 4 categories according to the manifestation of epilepsy in phenotypes.
84 epilepsy genes, i.e., genes that only cause epilepsies or syndromes with epilepsy as the core symptom.
73 neurodevelopment-associated genes, i.e., genes associated with gross brain developmental malformations and epilepsies.
536 epilepsy-related genes, i.e., genes associated with gross physical, or other systemic abnormalities and accompanied by epilepsy or seizures.
284 potential epilepsy-associated genes, i.e., genes that require further verification.
